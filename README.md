# tjTimeLib
Python Backend for tjTimeFace/tjTimeFaceC.
---
This short Google App Engine python script powers the tjTimeFace and tjTimeFaceC projects, which can be found on my GitHub at github.com/MK2018. The script simply parses schedule data from the web and converts it to a Pebble-Friendly JSON format.

For all who are curious, hosted at tjtimelib.appspot.com. Check it out. If you want to use this library for other projects, feel free, but don't abuse.
