# tjTimeLib

Python Backend for [tjTimeFace](https://github.com/MK2018/tjTimeFace)/[tjTimeFaceC](https://github.com/MK2018/tjTimeFaceC).


This short Google App Engine python script powers the [tjTimeFace](https://github.com/MK2018/tjTimeFace) and [tjTimeFaceC](https://github.com/MK2018/tjTimeFaceC) projects, which can be found on my GitHub at [MK2018](https://github.com/MK2018). The script simply parses schedule data from the web and converts it to a Pebble-Friendly JSON format.

For all who are curious, hosted at https://tjtimelib.appspot.com. Check it out. If you want to use this library for other projects, feel free, but don't abuse.
